A user registration form with validation and the ability to retrieve user data from an internet API are implemented in this project. The form guarantees that all necessary fields are filled up, verifies the email format, enforces the strength of the password, and displays error alerts in real time. Furthermore, user information is dynamically presented after being retrieved asynchronously from an API.
